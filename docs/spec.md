# Readlog Specification

Last updated: 2026-03-26

## Philosophy

- Plain markdown first
- One note per item
- Frontmatter is the source of truth
- Journal-like logging into plain markdown files
- No external dependencies in core book tracking

## v1

### Scope

Readlog v1 is book-focused. Articles and sidebar UI are intentionally deferred.

### Folder structure

```text
Reading/
├── Books/
│   ├── The Pragmatic Programmer.md
│   └── Dune.md
└── reading-log.md
```

The `Reading/` root folder and the `Books/` subfolder are configurable.

### Canonical book schema

```md
---
type: book
title: The Pragmatic Programmer
author: David Thomas, Andrew Hunt
status: reading
added: 2026-03-26
started: 2026-03-26
finished:
rating:
pages: 352
progress: 145
medium: ebook
device: Kindle Paperwhite
tags: [programming, craftsmanship]
---

## Cover

## Notes

## Citations

## Highlights
```

The `## Cover` section is intentionally manual. Readlog creates the heading, but it does not manage cover images or special cover metadata. If you want a cover, paste an Obsidian image embed there yourself.

### Status values

- `to-read`
- `reading`
- `done`
- `abandoned`

### Commands

#### `Readlog: Add book`

Creates a book note under `Reading/Books/`.

Inputs:

- title
- author
- medium
- device
- total pages
- tags
- initial status

Behavior:

- sets `added` to today
- sets `started` to today if the initial status is `reading`
- initializes `progress` to `0`
- creates the standard body sections, including `## Cover`

#### `Readlog: Edit book`

Updates metadata and reading state for an existing book.

Editable fields:

- title
- author
- medium
- device
- status
- pages
- progress
- tags
- started
- finished
- rating

Behavior rules:

- if status becomes `reading` and `started` is empty, set it to today
- if status becomes `done` and `finished` is empty, set it to today
- if title changes, rename the note file conservatively
- allows deleting the book note after confirmation
- deleting a book trashes only the note file and does not rewrite old daily-note or reading-log entries

#### `Readlog: Log reading session`

Logs a reading session for a book.

Inputs:

- book
- new current page
- optional minutes spent
- optional short session note

Behavior:

- reads the previous page from `progress`
- updates `progress` to the new current page
- sets `status: reading` if needed
- sets `started` if empty
- appends a new entry to `Reading/reading-log.md`
- appends one timestamped line to today’s daily note
- suggests finishing the book when progress reaches total pages

#### `Readlog: Add entry`

Adds either a note or a citation to a selected book.

Entry types:

- `note`
- `citation`

For notes, Readlog appends:

```md
**2026-03-26** - Your note text here.
```

For citations, Readlog appends:

```md
> "Your quoted text here." - p.42
```

The locator is optional and may also be a Kindle location such as `loc.1845-1848`.

### `reading-log.md`

This file is append-only and oldest-first.

Example:

```md
# Reading Log

## 2026-03-24
- **Dune** - *pages* 1-40 (*39 pages*, *20:10*)
  > Slow start but the world-building is already pulling me in.

## 2026-03-26
- **The Pragmatic Programmer** - *pages* 120-145 (*25 pages*, *35 min*, *21:14*)
  > Orthogonality section is dense, need to revisit tomorrow.
```

Readlog never rewrites old log entries.

### Daily note integration

When a reading session is logged, Readlog appends a plain line under a configurable markdown heading line in today’s daily note:

```md
##### *Reading*

- [[The Pragmatic Programmer]] - *pages* 120-145 (*21:14*, *35 min*)
```

The heading may be a full markdown heading such as `## Reading` or `##### *Reading*`. If the heading does not exist, it is created.

### Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Root folder | `Reading` | Base folder for all Readlog content |
| Books folder | `Books` | Subfolder used for book notes |
| Reading log filename | `reading-log.md` | Append-only reading session log |
| Daily notes folder template | `Daily` | Folder template used to resolve the daily note path |
| Daily note name template | `{year}-{month}-{day}` | Filename template used for the daily note basename |
| Daily note heading line | `## Reading` | Full markdown heading line Readlog appends under |

### Daily note shortcodes

Readlog supports these shortcodes in the daily notes folder template and the daily note name template:

- `{year}` -> `2025`
- `{month}` -> `01`
- `{day}` -> `06`
- `{weekday_short}` -> `Mon`
- `{weekday_long}` -> `Monday`

Example:

- folder template: `{year}-{month}`
- name template: `{year}-{month}-{day}_{weekday_short}`
- resolved path on January 6, 2025: `2025-01/2025-01-06_Mon.md`

Legacy filename formats like `YYYY-MM-DD` are migrated to shortcode form automatically.

## Kindle import

### Command

Readlog includes a local import command:

- `Readlog: Import Kindle Clippings`

This feature is intentionally scoped to the local `My Clippings.txt` file. No Amazon account login, cloud sync, or Kindle web scraping is part of the plugin.

### Import flow

1. Select a local `My Clippings.txt` file
2. Parse clipping entries into a structured intermediate model
3. Group entries by source book
4. Match each group to an existing Readlog book note
5. If a title is unmatched, optionally create a new book note for it
6. Import only new highlights and notes

### Matching rules

- first try case-insensitive exact title matching
- then try normalized title matching
- if multiple books match the same imported title, skip that title as ambiguous
- if no book matches, the user can import only into existing matches or let Readlog create missing book notes

New books created from Kindle import use conservative defaults:

- `status: to-read`
- `medium: ebook`
- `device: Kindle`
- no page count or progress inferred

### Mapping rules

- Kindle `Highlight` -> `## Citations`
- Kindle `Note` -> `## Notes`
- Kindle `Bookmark` -> ignored

Imported notes are appended as plain markdown, for example:

```md
**2025-01-02** - Imported from Kindle: Revisit the chapter on orthogonality. (loc. 400)
```

Imported highlights are appended as plain markdown, for example:

```md
> "Care about your craft." - p. 12; loc. 345-346
```

### Deduplication

Each imported clipping is fingerprinted from normalized title, author, clipping kind, locator, and text. Repeat imports skip fingerprints that have already been imported before.

### Non-goals for Kindle import

- no writes to `reading-log.md`
- no writes to daily notes
- no changes to reading progress
- no automatic status transitions for existing books
